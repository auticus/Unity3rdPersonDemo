# Unity3rdPersonDemo
 Unity 3rd Person Demo project.
This was a prototype using a state machine to change states.  It allows the player to move around using mixamo characters and animations.
Characters can lock on targeting and attack and do damage, and the enemy will chase the player.
Death sequences use ragdoll, which I wasn't entirely happy with.
